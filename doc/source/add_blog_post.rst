Add blog post
=============

1. Type your post in md

2. Add specific information at the top of the document as a header:

.. literalinclude:: ../../content/blog/en/linked-post.en.md
   :lines: 1-8

3. Save the file in :file:`content/blog/codeLang/` with filename :file:`name.codeLang.md`. Dispite codeLang in filename, the codeLang folder is not needed for hugo although it improves file organization.
