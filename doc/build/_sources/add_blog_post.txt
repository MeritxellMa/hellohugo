Add blog post
=============

1. Type your post in md

2. Add specific information at the top of the document as a header:

.. literalinclude:: ../../content/blog/en/linked-post.en.md
   :lines: 1-8

3. Save the file in :file:`content/blog/codeLang/`. This codeLang is a folder label for user organization but not needed for hugo.

4. Rename your file as :file:`filename.codeLang.md`
